# A Deep Learning Approach To Combating Automated And Deceptive Online Reviews. 

Thesis:

1.1 Aim:

To implement a deep learning model that performs better than a human at detecting automated and deceptive reviews online. 
	
1.2 Objectives:

Identify pre-existing anti-bot solutions for review-based platforms and any flaws that may exist.
Create two models to generate fake reviews based on research findings. 
Use existing datasets to analyse human language and produce generated reviews.
Use of existing pre-trained models. 
Evaluate each model's performance against one another based on the quality of generated review language.
Create a model to perform classification on a larger dataset containing real reviews and fake reviews produced from the previously made model.
Pre-process available datasets for use in the model by cleaning data and identifying available methods for processing.
Identify the level of success that would deem the model to work and what quantifiable measurements can be used.
Find appropriate algorithms to help aid the classification model.
Evaluate the model with unseen test data and to what degree of quantifiable success.
Evaluate the model's performance level of fake review detection against other models that have been made from past research.
Build a mock review web application for users to leave reviews and test the model.
